# Introduction

With our project, our group GPJ is committed to making the best financial/budgeting tracker we possibly can. Within our website,
we plan to allow all users to be able to input any given money situation whether they are spending or gaining. Within the website, 
some features will include:
- Ability to input yearly/monthly income
- Ability to input expenses that are catorgorized by genre of purchase (car, food, micellaneous, etc.)
- Pie chart to show percentages of what you are spending your money on
- Ability to create a profile and login that is secure
- Ability to input known spending such as rent and utilities
- Ability to input savings funds

# Anticipated Technologies

- Python
- VS Code
- Haven't decided on libraries to use yet

# Method/Approach

In our plan of attack, firstly, we figured out features. Next, out plan is to figure the responsibilities of each team member,
and assign roles and positions in which will benefit our work progress and efficiency over the course of the next several weeks.
After this, we plan to decide exactly what technologies we are going to use such as coding language, libraries, and our V-Model as well
as update out Jira, GitHub, Burn Down Graph and Grantt Chart. The next step from here is to develop and produce the code and interfaces we
are going to use to physically run and produce the output of our website meeting all necessary requirements and features we are adding. Finally,
we plan to throughly test and document our progress to ensure this website is runs smoothly and the best we can get it to be. 

# Estimated Timeline

Our plan for the timeline is to work diligently and efficiently over the next weeks planning on different milestones a week. Our milestones that 
we have planned as of right now, include:
- Week of 10/14/2024: Figure out roles, positions, languages, libraries etc.
- Week of 10/21/2024: Set basic code and outline for our project aka an overall basis and general idea of the developing outline
- Week of 10/28/2024: Work on features and implementing the libraries necessary for these features
- Week of 11/04/2024: Work on the layout of the website and where these features and spots where these features will be applied within the website
- Week of 11/11/2024: Continue working on overall code and all features involved within the website
- Week of 11/18/2024: Start testing and making sure everything within the website runs smoothly
- Week of 11/25/2024: Continue testing and working out all bugs and issues that we have within the website
- Week of 12/02/2024: Finalize project, features, and everything that needs to be included within the website
- Week of 12/08/2024: Turn in final project/website

# Anticipated Problems

A few potential problems that GPJ sees that could potentially happen is firstly, time management and getting our neccesary work to be completed
on time and to its fullest. Another problem we see could happen is working with bugs and issues related to the code, libraries, or any of the 
developing aspects of the project. A final problem we could see happening is the milestones and how we complete them within the given timeframe as we
could run into multiple problems at any given point therefore setting us back or having us to backtrack to fix these problems.
