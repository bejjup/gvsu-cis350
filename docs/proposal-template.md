# Introduction

Our concept is to create a fully functional minesweeper roguelike game. This will involve creating a minesweeper board with a leveling system that will get more difficult the more you play. Additionally, the game will have a currency system that will scale based on the tile numbers. The numbers discovered on the board will directly equate to the coins earned.
This program will take the classic minesweeper format and put a spin on it. Minesweeper is a logic-based game that reads tiles corresponding to the number of mines adjacent to that tile. Once you find a number, you narrow down where a mine is and place a flag on it. This will increment a counter for each flag placed. You will lose if you fail to detect a mine and click on it.


# Anticipated Technologies

We are planning on using Python and JavaScript for backend and frontend programming. This could change in the future.

# Method/Approach

We are planning on using a V-model for our approach. This way, we can set up a simple system that involves testing right after programming. For instance, we finish a major milestone, we implement unit testing for it, continue refining for that milestone until itâ€™s complete, and then move on to programming for the next milestone.

# Estimated Timeline

- Game board - 2 weeks
- Game logic - 4 weeks
- UI - 4 weeks
- Sprites - 4 weeks
- Ability and coin system - 3 weeks


# Anticipated Problems

- Translating Python game code to a Javascript UI
- Programming game logic / recursion
