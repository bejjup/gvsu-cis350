# Introduction

We are creating a Fortnite edition of the classic Monopoly game where players can play against other players or CPUs. In this game, we are replacing the money with materials such as wood, brick, and steel. These materials will help you build in the different locations on the map to protect yourself, but once you’re out of materials, you get sniped and lose the game. Even though there is already a Fortnite-themed Monopoly game that’s been widely produced, we feel like it didn’t do a good enough job of capturing the real Fortnite feel. We want to end up creating a better version of Fortnite Monopoly that offers a better playing experience.

In our game, we also plan on adding a few features like a roll-the-dice feature, a train, aCPU player feature, and a CPU difficulty setting which makes the overall game easier or more challenging. The roll-the-dice feature will simply roll a six sided die indicating how many spaces you move. Our train will be moving around on the map like it does in the original Fortnite game; this will make it easier to jump around from location to location. The CPUs offer a single player mode, and the varying skill differences of the AI will make the game either more casual and friendly or more intense and thrilling.

# Anticipated Technologies

We are going to be mainly using Python to code our game while also including a material management system to keep track of the loot. We will also use some sort of photo editing software to make the game board that we will be using for our final project.

# Method/Approach

Every week, our team will have two meetings up until the final project deadline; one with Praharsha, one with only our group members. Our meetings with Praharsha will focus more on the time crunch aspect, so we will mainly discuss our process and how we plan on completing our project on time. Our meetings with only our group members will focus on actually building our project in a way that we all agree with and possibly brainstorming new ideas as they come across.

# Estimated Timeline

Major milestones to reach: \n
  .Building the map
  .Roll-the-dice feature
  .CPU’s
  .CPU varying difficulties
  .Final project
  I think that building an interactive map will be a slight challenge since our whole group is mainly Python coders, but it shouldn’t take any longer than a week once we focus on it. Our dice feature shouldn’t take long at all as it is a fairly simple concept, probably just a day. Our CPU feature could definitely be the most challenging part of this entire project as we have to make the CPUs first, then make varying levels of difficulty. This will take a bit longer than any of our other features and will be a huge milestone crossed off once it’s done. I expect this feature to take anywhere from 2 weeks to a month depending on how solely focused we are on it. Our final project is the last milestone and it includes touching up on all aspects of the project and making sure it is a well designed game in full. This will take close to the final project deadline to complete as there are a lot of little details that should be perfected by then.

# Anticipated Problems

As of right now, I don’t foresee too many problems that we’ll face. However, if the CPU difficulty feature ends up being too complicated, it could take too much focus from each of us and slow down the entire process of the project. We must maintain good time management in order to get everything done that we want to get done.
