# Introduction

Our project is working to address the issue of a general lack of energy in the morning, as well minimal exercise or incentive to exercise. With this in mind we've started planning an iOS application that would help achieve both! Our intention is to build an app that will allow you to wake up and do a quick exercise. This will challenge people do wake up and make the first thing they do in the morning hopefully the hardest part of there day in a bite sized kind of way. Whether it be stamina with a plank, or strength with pushups, the only barier to entry is a phone in hand. 

All members in our group believe that an active life improves mental well-being as well as provides are more natural way to 'start your engine' so to say. We seek to personalize the project to help allow anyone from any range of exercising background a change to train.  This is a goal we believe in individually and a goal we can achieve as a group.

# Anticipated Technologies

*We are going to used JavaScript + React to build the interface of the website. If we plan on doing data handling we probably will end up using a DataBase like MariaDB or MySQL (by microsoft)
* We are going to be needing to use different React librarys like Material UI.
* JIRA for group organizing, bug fixing, and coordinating pushes and Merging
* VScode as our programming interface

# Method/Approach

In our meeting today we discussed attacking this project in 3 different phases

1. Deal with the initial opening of the application. This involves user selecting information such as: workout intensity, duration, time of day they'd prefer to be notified, etc. 
2. Deal with researching the best workouts to achieve what people want. Try to make the application as personal as possible. This will probably be the most research heavy and programming intensive.
3. Bug fixing and getting user experience and feedback. This is how we will make sure that we create an experience that applys to as many people as possible and is as user friendly as possible. 

# Estimated Timeline

In this next week, we will have our group roles figured out and JIRA sorted to allow us to seemlessly communicate errors and progress.

Following that we assume we will take a minimum of 2 weeks to finish the questionare side of our project.

spending 3 weeks creating the backend where we start researching and personalizing this application for the average user.

late November early December for bug fixing and beta testing. 

December (finals): Have a completed and polished final project!


# Anticipated Problems

A majority of the group is unfamiliar with React as a coding language. So there will be a learning curve, definitely leading to a lot of the issues we may face in that first two weeks (Questionaire phase)

Researching will be interesting

Porting to iOS will be new.

Those are the only forseable problems that we have been able to come up with so far. It's hard to know the issues ahead when dealing with a new language and platform.
