Time: 1:30-2:00

Discussion points: 

* Discussed a good starting point for our project. (essentially discussed the project timeline.) Dylan and Rachael were feeling a little overwhelmed with choosing a start point and Rahasha helped guide us in the right direction!
* Talked about the goal behind setting milestones and essentially worked to break up the project into bite sized pieces. 
* Talked about creating a JIRA group and starting to set up our timeline. 
* Still need to choose a leader.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Have a leader select, roles created, and a JIRA made
* We want to at minimum have a starting point to work from
* Make sure the team gets on the same page since we seem to be not coordinating together well.
