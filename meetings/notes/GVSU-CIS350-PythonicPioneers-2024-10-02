Discussion points: 

* Non-functional vs Functional requirements
  - Non-functional: There won't be a ton of nun-funcional elements to this game since only one player will be playing at a time
  - Functional: Most of the game will be accessable to the user
* Reward system that scales
* Minimum set amount of tiles
* Figuring out a game end-state
* Portability will be easy except for console players
* We will have to be the "customer" for the V-Model

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Researching how to get a display working for our base (Brody)
* Gathering requirements and figuring them out ourselves
* Figuring out 2 functional and 2 non-functional requirements for the project which we will meet up and do tomorrow (10/3) after class
