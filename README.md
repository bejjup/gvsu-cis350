# Pythonic Pioneers

##  Project Description

Our concept is creating a fully functional minesweeper roguelike game. This will involve creating a minesweeper board with a leveling system that will get more difficult the more you play. Additionally, the game will have a currency system that will scale based on the tile numbers. The numbers discovered on the board will directly equate to the coins earned.
