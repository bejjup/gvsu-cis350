# Loot Lakers

We have decided to make a game of Fortnite monopoly as the orignal was lack luster. To improve on the game we have decided to implement a material cost instead of a monetary cost to buy and build the locations and homes. This was it can capture more of the aspect of Fortnite as well as the feeling of monopoly. The various chance cards will also reflect the Fortnite theme overall delivering a more Fortnite like feel
